*Insert project name here*
Elias, Jason, and Joseph's final project for MKS65
Period 10

The project is a simple turn-based RPG game. It follows a linear story. It will use two main c files: one that the player will execute, and one that controls the enemies of the game. The game will also integrate simple graphics.

Elias will write the story for the game as well as the code for random item drops after defeating an enemy.
Jason will create the simple graphics.
Joseph will write the code used by the player.
The AI code will be a combined effort of all members of the team.

Multiple data structures will be used.
Arrays: Health bar and backpack storage. Random item drops.
Structs: An enemy struct will be used to create enemies. An item struct will be used to create items.
