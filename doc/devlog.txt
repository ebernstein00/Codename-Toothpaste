add_item() and remove_item() functions in character.c work with limited functionality. Bug where swords don't actually buff defense, needs to be looked into, and adding a potion when potion slots are already full only empties one slot. Next up: networking.

basic game functionality works. Character has stats, backpack full of items, etc. Now, all thats left is the actual game mechanics. Possibly mechanics.c?

began working on items.c file.

Finished character.c and character.h files to instantiate new beings, allocate memory for them,
and print them.

perused network.c and network.h files, I think I understand them. Server and
client files still make absoultely no sense to me.
