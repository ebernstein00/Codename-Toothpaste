Fully functional GUI and gameflow! Game works smooth as butter, with some minor bugs.

lamJas -- 2020-01-20-1:30
Began refactoring graphics and gameflow code together. Dealing with seg fault and merge issues. Merged makefile. Consolidated excess headers.

lamJas -- 2020-01-18 15:30
Now renders with a single command, instead of multiple commands. Added ID tags to characters. Consolidated make file to run off a single main file. Added Kirby-themed background to GUI.

lamJas -- 2020-01-17 23:50

bernsteinEli -- 2020-01-14 15:30
Added beginnings of a create_item_pool() function to create an array of every item in items.c to use later in
random drop code.

lamJas -- 2020-01-13 15:35
GUI works, with functioning buttons that show animations when pressed. Also prints out to the command prompt which button is being pressed.

bernsteinEli -- 2020-01-13 15:30
Created gameflow.c file for gameplay mechanics. Added attack(), use_item(), guard_start(), and guard_end()
code.

lamJas -- 2020-01-12 10:00
Set up viewports, to split the GUI and the game. In addition, began work on a simple button press and made images for buttons.

lamJas -- 2020-01-11 01:30
Rendered the first animated sprite into the renderer.

yusufovJos -- 2020-01-10 22:10
add_item() and remove_item() functions in character.c work with limited functionality. Bug where swords don't actually buff defense, needs to be looked into, and adding a potion when potion slots are already full only empties one slot. Next up: networking.

lamJas -- 2020-01-09 23:20
Rendered a basic hello world window. Began work on cutting up spritesheet.

yusufovJos -- 2020-01-09 22:00
Basic game functionality works. Character has stats, backpack full of items, etc. Now, all thats left is the actual game mechanics. Possibly mechanics.c?

yusufovJos -- 2020-01-09 10:20
Began working on items.c file.

lamJas -- 2020-01-07 23:00
Began work on graphics, and decided on using SDL rather than GTK.

yusufovJos -- 2020-01-07 00:30
Finished character.c and character.h files to instantiate new beings, allocate memory for them,
and print them.

yusufovJos -- 2020-01-07 20:00
Perused network.c and network.h files, I think I understand them. Server and
client files still make absoultely no sense to me.

bernsteinEli -- 2020-01-03 15:30
Added functions to make different types of items as struct items in items.c such as armor, swords, potions, and
enchanted items.
